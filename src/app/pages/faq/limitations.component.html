    Limitations

        Currently, the <em>export package</em> is created using <strong>Delivery API</strong>, and as such it cannot
        make
        an
        identical copy of your project. Some information is not available through Delivery API and is lost during
        export/import process. Once the <strong>Content managemenent API</strong> is mature enough, this application
        will switch to it to create better export packages with more information.

        <mat-list role="list">
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">1) Content type snippets are not preserved, but data is not lost. Instead,
                these
                elements are created on each content type separately.</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">2) Components in rich text elements are created as standalone linked items
                (they
                are preserved correctly in rich text values)</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">3) Content type configuration is lost (e.g. size limitations for assets,
                allowed content types for linked item elements...). After importing you should go through the content types and add necessary configuration.</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">4) Only published items are exported</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">5) Assets folder categorization is not preserved and assets are created in
                flat structure</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">6) API does not allow setting specific codenames and it may happen that
                certain items/types/assets will have different codename and in some cases name (e.g. asset name might not be present in Delivery response)</mat-list-item>
            <mat-list-item role="listitem">7) API does not allow to set the element guidelines, this information is not preserved.</mat-list-item>
